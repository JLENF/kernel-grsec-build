# Built Packages Directory

## Description
This directory contains RPM (Red Hat Package Manager) and DEB (Debian) files generated by the build process.

## Introduction
RPM and DEB files are used for packaging software in systems running on the Package Manager. This directory serves as a repository for all RPM and DEB files generated during the build process.

## Usage - RPM
To use these RPM files, you can install them on compatible systems using the appropriate package manager. For example, on Red Hat-based systems, you can use `yum` or `dnf`:

```bash
# Using yum - Centos7
sudo yum install <package-name>.rpm

# Using DNF - Rockylinux 8
sudo dnf install <package-name>.rpm
```

## Usage - DEB
To use these DEB files, you can install them on compatible systems using the appropriate package manager. For example, on Debian-based systems, you can use `dpkg`:

```bash
# Using dnf - Debian 10
sudo dpkg -i <package-name>.deb
```
